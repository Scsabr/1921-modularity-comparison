# 1921 Modularity Comparison

Here is (some) of the code for last year's programming project.

This was to do with some image file handling and compression - I've included a single main() file: `ebfEcho.c` and the modules needed to make this work (split into .c and .h files - more on that next week!).

Have a go at tracing the program execution through - and review the code as you do!
